Performed a detailed data analysis and developed an interactive dashboard leveraging Power BI. This project involved extracting insights from historical hotel operations data, calculating essential performance metrics, and designing intuitive visualizations to aid strategic decision-making. The dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear view of critical business indicators such as occupancy rates and revenue trends, supporting informed and data-driven management actions to regain market share and improve profitability.

## DATA MODEL 

Data Modeling
To enable robust analysis and insightful reporting, I performed comprehensive data modeling on the provided hotel operations dataset using Power BI. The process involved:
1)Designing a star schema with clearly defined dimension and fact tables (e.g., dim_date, dim_hotel, dim_rooms, fact_bookings, fact_aggregated_bookings).
2)Establishing primary and foreign key relationships to accurately link booking, property, room, and date information.
3)Normalizing attributes across tables for data consistency and efficient querying.
