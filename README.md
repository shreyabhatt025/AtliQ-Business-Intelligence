Performed a detailed data analysis and developed an interactive dashboard leveraging Power BI. This project involved extracting insights from historical hotel operations data, calculating essential performance metrics, and designing intuitive visualizations to aid strategic decision-making. The dashboard provides stakeholders with a clear view of critical business indicators such as occupancy rates and revenue trends, supporting informed and data-driven management actions to regain market share and improve profitability.

## DATA MODEL 

Data Modeling - This structured data model provided a scalable foundation for metric computation, advanced analytics, and the creation of interactive dashboards tailored to stakeholder requirements.
To enable robust analysis and insightful reporting, I performed comprehensive data modeling on the provided hotel operations dataset .  The process involved:
1)Designing a star schema with clearly defined dimension and fact tables (e.g., dim_date, dim_hotel, dim_rooms, fact_bookings, fact_aggregated_bookings).
2)Establishing primary and foreign key relationships to accurately link booking, property, room, and date information.
3)Normalizing attributes across tables for data consistency and efficient querying.
4)Ensuring referential integrity to support reliable metric calculations and dynamic dashboard visualizations.
